"Compassion Fatigue","Compassion Fatigue training seeks to educate participants on the natures of Burnout and Compassion
Fatigue, provide clarification through lively discussion, engaging activities, and self-assessment, and
incorporate coping strategies and techniques for adjustment whether personal or work-related. Many
have found this training to be valuable to their longevity in chosen professions and have applied
associated tools throughout their continued work and personal relationships and environments.
Additional Information:
Burnout is associated with stress and hassles involved in your work; it is very cumulative, is relatively predictable and frequently a vacation or change of job helps a great deal.  Compassion Fatigue is a state of tension and preoccupation with the individual or cumulative trauma of clients as manifested in one or more ways including re-experiencing the traumatic event, avoidance/numbing or reminder of the event and persistent arousal.  You are absorbing the trauma through the eyes and ears of your clients. It can be thought of as secondary post-traumatic stress.",4/24/2020,4/24/2020,,"8:00 AM","5:00 PM","Cornerstone Building (CNST)",,,,,,CNST157,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,rina.martinez@aims.edu,,,,,,,,"General Public, Current Students, Alumni, Faculty & Staff, Prospective Students","Campus Life"
